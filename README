Shuriken is an open source, research-grade continous-energy Monte Carlo code developed to test transport methods. Specifically, this repository provides test cases for neutron unresolved resonance physics and sensitivity coefficient calculation.

Shuriken is written in C++17 and tested using the compiler g++ (GCC) 13.2.1 20231205 (Red Hat 13.2.1-6)

The source code may be built from a simple Makefile and creates four executables:
  1) shuriken_ab12 for two analytical benchmarks
  2) shuriken_ab3 for a third analytical benchmark
  3) shuriken_bigten for the BIGTEN benchmark
  4) shuriken_mcfr for a molten chloride fast reactor model
The differences between each of these is they have their own main routine, as Shuriken, being a research code, does not support I/O.
